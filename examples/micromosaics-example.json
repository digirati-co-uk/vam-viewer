          "In addition to work for the Holy See, the mosaicists of the Vatican also produced pictures on commission or for general sale, including subjects such as this cavalier. The portrait-like nature of this image has parallels with the contemporary fashion for being photographed in historic costume, though it is not known if this is an actual portrait. Tarantoni has used paint, now partly discoloured, to make the face more convincing. The tesserae that depict the stone wall are arranged in a way that is comparable to those used in the backgrounds of the first generation of micromosaicists (see first slide)."
